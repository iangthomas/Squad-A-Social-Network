# Squad: a Social Network
A privacy-centered social network, that organizes friends by "fuzzy" locations. <br /><br />

Do you have a hard time keeping track of your extended group of friends?
“Did so-and-so just move to Springfield? But which one?”<br /><br />

Many social networks require users to manually update their present location, but few people  do. With Squad, user locations are updated automatically, but these updates are purposely “fuzzy.” The App only shares the city (with a population over 150,000) you are nearest.<br /><br />

The focus here is privacy and geography.<br /><br />

You can only friend fellow users if they give you their secret pin number.
When you a traveling, open the App and see if your friends are in the same city.
Send them a message and meet up IRL.<br /><br />
